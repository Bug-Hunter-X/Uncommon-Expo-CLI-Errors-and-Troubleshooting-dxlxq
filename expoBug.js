This error occurs when using the Expo CLI and involves issues with the project's configuration or dependencies. The exact cause varies, but it often stems from mismatched versions of Expo packages, incorrect configurations in `app.json` or `package.json`, or problems with the underlying Node.js environment.  The error message itself might be generic or point towards a specific issue with a dependency or a configuration file. For example, it might mention a missing module, a version conflict, or a problem during the build process.  Debugging this requires careful examination of error messages, package versions, and configuration files.
