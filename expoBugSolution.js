Solutions vary depending on the specific error encountered.  Common solutions involve:

1. **Checking package versions:** Ensure all Expo packages are compatible. Use `npm ls expo` or `yarn why expo` to inspect dependencies and resolve conflicting versions.  Update packages using `npm update` or `yarn upgrade`.
2. **Reviewing configuration files:**  Carefully examine `app.json` and `package.json` for any typos, incorrect settings, or missing configurations.  Refer to the Expo documentation for accurate configuration guidelines.
3. **Verifying Node.js environment:**  Ensure you're using a compatible and updated version of Node.js and npm/yarn. Use `node -v` and `npm -v` (or `yarn -v`) to check versions.
4. **Cleaning the project:** Sometimes, a clean build can resolve issues. Try `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` or `rm -rf node_modules && yarn install`.
5. **Checking for other dependency issues:** Investigate other dependencies beyond Expo that might be causing conflicts. Examine the full error message for clues.
6. **Expo doctor:** Run `expo doctor` to identify potential configuration or environment problems. This might offer specific suggestions on how to rectify your environment.
7. **Community support:** If the problem persists, seeking assistance from the Expo community forums or GitHub issues can often lead to a solution.
